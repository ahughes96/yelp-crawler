# Multithreaded Yelp page results crawler

1) I have given a sample page results crawler, i implemented for one of my personal projects.

2) It uses urllib, lxml, and multiprocessing libraries in python to parallelly download pages off yelp and 
harvest the results.

3) This was coded in 2015, so if the UI changes ( cosmetic changes ), this might not work right now.

4) If you understand the simple code base, all you have to do to survive the yelp cosmetic changes, is to simply use new xpath.

5) I am not a python guy, so if you have a better way to do this, please share !!
